# Problem 
1. Limited Market Reach
    there is still no simple platform that support artisan, Many artisans rely on local markets, craft fairs, or word-of-mouth to sell their            products, limiting their potential customer base to a small geographic area
  
2. Time constraints and inefficient sales management
   Many artisans are focused on creating their products and may not have time to deal with the administrative tasks of managing orders, payments,      and customer interactions manually.

# Solution
 and then freeing up more time for artisans to focus on their craft by order tracking, payment processing, and customer communication.The app        allows artisans to reach a regional audience, expanding beyond their local region. This can significantly increase their sales opportunities and    customer base.

 # Stakeholders
 Customer Support Team
 Artisans (Primary End-Users)
 Buyers (Secondary End-Users)
 Software Developer Team

 # Features 
1. “Story Mode” for Products:
Story mode will be for the End-user (artisan) option, to let them write the story on the highlight product they sell.

2. Search and Filtering Options:
we want the searchbar application is usable for the end-user to find specific product and users

3. Artisan Profile Creation
Artisans can create profiles that showcase their brand, story, and expertise.

4. In-app Chat 
end user(artisan) and second end user(customers) will be able to communicate, we plan to let them communicate after the second end user 

5. Verified End User
end user will need to be verified by administrator to be able to start their selling

# Constrain
1. Administrator must verified the end user data, this will achieve by put submit data system on the app and face-check
2. in-app purchased security must be secure, we will use external service payment and the administrator will follow-up the transaction process
3.
