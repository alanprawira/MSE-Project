# Problem 
1. Limited Market Reach
    there is still no simple platform that support artisan, Many artisans rely on local markets, craft fairs, or word-of-mouth to sell their            products, limiting their potential customer base to a small geographic area
  
2. Time constraints and inefficient sales management
   Many artisans are focused on creating their products and may not have time to deal with the administrative tasks of managing orders, payments,      and customer interactions manually.

# Solution
 and then freeing up more time for artisans to focus on their craft by order tracking, payment processing, and customer communication.The app        allows artisans to reach a regional audience, expanding beyond their local region. This can significantly increase their sales opportunities and    customer base.
